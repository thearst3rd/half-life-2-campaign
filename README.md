## FAQs
* _Are there Sandbox features?_ - no and I don't plan to add them.
* _I host a dedicated server!_ - type `gamemode half-life_2_campaign` in the console.
* _Does it come with Half-Life 2 maps?_ - this is a gamemode, not a content pack. I will not include the maps from HL2 as it's illegal.
* _Can I play the Episodes?_ - there is no support for the Episodes yet.
* _Can I get rid of the HL2 crosshair?_ - yes! Just type `hud_draw_fixed_reticle 0` in the console.
